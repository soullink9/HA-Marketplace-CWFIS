# Contributing to CWFIS

Thanks for helping. [Development](docs/Development.md) is the map of the code: where things live, how the data
flows, and how to run the simulation. This page has the rules every change keeps and how to release one.

## Checking a change

```
pip install ruff
ruff check && ruff format --check
python3 tests/test_integration.py
```

The simulation needs Python 3.13 and nothing else. GitHub Actions runs the same checks, plus Home Assistant's
`hassfest` and the Marketplace's own checks, on every push.

## Standards for every change

- **Readable over clever.** Write code a newcomer can follow on the first read. Prefer a few plain lines with a named
  variable to a dense one-liner, a nested conditional expression, or a trick that needs a comment to decode.
- **Comment the why.** Every function and class has a docstring. Comments explain why the code does something
  non-obvious (a quirk of the device or service, a Home Assistant rule, a deliberate trade-off), not what each line
  does.
- **Keep names consistent.** Follow the names already used in the integration: the same words for
  the same things, Home Assistant's conventions for entities and config entries, `snake_case` for Python names and
  `camelCase` for JavaScript.
- **Keep the docs in step.** When you change a function, class or behaviour, update its docstring, its comments and the
  pages under `docs/` (and the README) that describe it in the same commit.
- **Keep the tests green.** Every change keeps existing behaviour and passes all of the tests. When you
  fix a bug, add the situation that caused it to the tests so it stays fixed.
- **No new dependencies without approval.** Don't add a third-party library (to a `manifest.json`, a
  `requirements.txt` or CI) without asking in an issue first. This page says what it already depends on and why.

### Test layout

The tests use these names:

```
tests/
  stubs.py                stand-ins for Home Assistant and the libraries the integration uses
  test_integration.py     the real integration against the stand-ins and a fake device or service
  test_<subject>.py       any other checks (test_engine.py, test_blueprint.py, test_live_proxy.py)
  test_<subject>_soak.py  a long simulation: it takes a length as an argument, and CI runs a short one
  fake_<service>.py       a fake device or service, when it's too big to live inside the test
  requirements.txt        what the tests need beyond Python, if they need anything
```

Every `test_*.py` is a plain script, not a pytest suite: run it with `python3` from the repository root, and it
exits non-zero if any check fails.

### The Marketplace

`hacs.json` at the root is the Marketplace's file: the name it lists and the oldest Home Assistant version the
integration works with. Keep that version in step with the README's requirements.

## Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): a type, an optional scope, then a short summary in
the imperative.

```
feat: add a diagnostics download
fix: keep the last value when the service is briefly unreachable
refactor: split the coordinator's update into steps
docs: explain the safety settings
test: cover a reply with a missing field
chore: update the CI actions
```

## Releasing

1. Change `version` in `custom_components/cwfis/manifest.json`.
2. Add the release to the top of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
3. Run the checks above and make sure CI is green.
4. Publish it: push the tag (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`), or open **Actions → Release → Run
   workflow** and enter the version. The [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) checks the manifest
   and `CHANGELOG.md` are at that version, then publishes the GitHub release the Marketplace installs from.

## Reporting bugs

[Open an issue](https://github.com/soullink9/HA-Marketplace-CWFIS/issues/new/choose) with your Home Assistant version, the integration's version,
what you did and what you expected. The log helps: **Settings → System → Logs**, search for `cwfis`.
